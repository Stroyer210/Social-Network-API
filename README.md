## Description  :bookmark_tabs:
My Social Network API is a project that I designed because I wanted to see how a network API worked using MongoDB. Motivated by a vision of creating a platform where users can freely share thoughts, connect with friends, and express reactions. Through this endeavor, I immersed myself in API design, mastering CRUD operations for users and thoughts while also implementing features for managing reactions and friendships. This project has been a great learning experience, teaching me the intricacies of data modeling, system architecture, and user-centric design of MongoDB. It has reinforced the importance of databases in real-world applications for me.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check a video of the functionality of the app, you can go to this URL: 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to have "Node.js" installed in your computer, then you have to clone my repository and run it locally.

## Usage :bar_chart:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, and do not forget to run the next lines of code to start the app:
    
    npm i

After that run one of the next line:

    npm start

You will be prompted with a title of the app, so now you can test it in Insomnia, we can GET all users:

We can GET all thoughts:

And we can do lots of things, such adding more thoughts, updating and deleting them. Adding reactions, also adding friends to the User and whatnot.
